# connectfour_ga
First GA Project - Connect Four 
  This project was a first attempt at using a mix of Javascript, Jquery, HTML5, and CSS3 to create a working application.  It is meant to be played by two players, and functions like the game Connect Four.   It was created in an object oriented way, using constructors to create the playable cells, and the board, each with prototypes.  The game itself was represented by an object literal.
